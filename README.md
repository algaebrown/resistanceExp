# resistanceExp
My research project on antibiotic resistance prediction

# file structure:
1. in **Drug** folder, there are codes for TMACC, CHEBI, all kinds of drug database and chemical descriptor
2. in **Genome** folder, codes are about CARD, CD-hit, COG
3. in **MIC** folder, codes are mainly related to CLSI re-annotation
4. in **model** folder, codes are all about training svm and nb models
5. the **visulazation folder** contains all sorts of jupyter notebook, mainly used to plot
6. `cleanData.py` selects data that fits our need (with MIC instead of disk diffusion, the right species ...etc)
